        <p>Nouns in Arabic are words that refer to a person, place, thing, or idea. They can be definite or indefinite.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Verbs (Fi'l)</h2>
        <p>Verbs in Arabic indicate actions or states of being. They are conjugated based on tense, person, and number.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Particles (Harf)</h2>

        <h2>4. Sentence Structure</h2>
        <p>Arabic sentences can be nominal (starting with a noun) or verbal (starting with a verb).</p>
